## Healthy Corners
<br/>

::: faq What is Healthy Corners?
Healthy Corners is a [DC Central Kitchen (DCCK)](https://dccentralkitchen.org/) social enterprise that strives to expand healthy food access in DC. We deliver fresh and frozen and healthy snacks to corner stores in areas where food access is limited, offering produce at wholesale prices and providing marketing and technical assistance to store owners. 
:::

::: faq How do I save at Healthy Corners stores?
- **Low prices** -  Healthy Corners keeps prices low for stores and customers. Prices are listed on each product in the app and on the Healthy Corners product and pricing lists at stores. 
- **SNAP matching** - If a store offers SNAP Matching, shoppers who purchase fresh or frozen products with SNAP can get more fresh or frozen products for free. To earn a $5 coupon for fresh for frozen products, spend at least $5 with SNAP at a participating store and include at least 1 item of fresh or frozen produce in your purchase. 

[comment]: <> (- **Healthy Rewards** - At select stores, earn points every time you buy Healthy Corners products including fresh produce, frozen produce, and healthy snacks. When you’ve earned 500 points, get $5 free! Look for “Healthy Rewards” on the store profile to find stores that offer this program. )

::: faq Who runs and supports Healthy Corners?

### Products & Prices
<br/>

:::faq What does it mean if a store shows 'No recent deliveries'?
“No recent deliveries” means a store has not received a Healthy Corners delivery in the past week. The store may have fruits and vegetables in stock from another vendor. 
:::

:::faq How often are products listed in the app updated?
Products are updated daily at 5 PM EST.
:::

:::faq How are prices set?
Prices are set quarterly with the seasons: summer, fall, winter, and spring. Healthy Corners charges stores the cost of produce from distributors and has very low minimums for stores. Many products are further discounted to allow for easy access to customers while giving stores profit. Stores are expected to follow the customer prices set by Healthy Corners. Occasionally the price for an item will change mid-season due to factors like weather or supply chain issues, but Healthy Corners strives to maintain stable pricing throughout the season.
:::

:::faq Why are the prices listed on this app different from the prices in-store?
Healthy Corners stores agree to charge customers no higher than the displayed prices for their items. However, it can be difficult to regulate this across all stores and employees. If prices do not match what you see in the app, it could be because a clerk is not aware of a price change or because the manager has not updated the prices in the cash register. If stores choose to buy fresh produce from other vendors, those items may also have different prices.If you notice this while shopping, you can ask the store manager or [submit the feedback form](https://airtable.com/shr1Rh6ZUaJNQTQqf) to Healthy Corners.
:::

### Stores
<br/>

:::faq How are stores chosen for Healthy Corners?
To qualify for Healthy Corners, a store must: 
- Serve a low-income population
- Be located in an area where food security needs are not being met, especially by full-service grocery stores 
- Have owners that are committed to promoting healthy and affordable food in the community 
:::

:::faq I know a store that would make a great addition to Healthy Corners. How can I recommend them?
