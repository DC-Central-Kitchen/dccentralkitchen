### Products & Prices
<br/>

:::faq What does it mean if a store shows 'No recent deliveries'?
“No recent deliveries” means a store has not received a Healthy Corners delivery in the past week. The store may have fruits and vegetables in stock from another vendor or a previous delivery. 
:::

:::faq How often are products listed in the app updated?
Products are updated daily at 5 PM EST.
:::

:::faq How are prices set?
Prices are set quarterly with the seasons: summer, fall, winter, and spring. Healthy Corners charges stores the exact cost of produce from distributors, with no minimums or markups. In the event of COVID-19, prices have been further discounted: 25% off whole fruits and 50% off whole vegetables. Stores are expected to follow the customer prices set by Healthy Corners. Occasionally the price for an item will change mid-season due to factors like weather or supply chain issues.
:::

:::faq Why are the prices listed on this app different from the prices in-store?
Healthy Corners stores agree to charge customers no higher than the displayed prices for their items. However, it can be difficult to regulate this across all stores and employees. If prices do not match what you see in the app, it could be because a clerk is not aware of a price change or because the manager has not updated the prices in the cash register. If stores choose to buy fresh produce from other vendors, those items may also have different prices. If you notice this while shopping, you can ask the store manager or [submit the feedback form](https://airtable.com/shr1Rh6ZUaJNQTQqf) to Healthy Corners.
:::

### Stores

:::faq How are stores chosen for Healthy Corners?
To qualify for Healthy Corners, a store must: 
- serve a low-income population
- be located in an area where food security needs are not being met by full-service grocery stores
