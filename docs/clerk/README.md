# Clerk Application

Android-compatible tablet application created with React Native, Expo, and Airtable as a backend / database. \*We do not deploy to the iOS App Store because this application was specifically designed for Android tablets.

This repo contains code for the clerk-facing application, designed for usage in parallel with a store's existing POS system (**not** to replace it). This README is meant to be a guide for contributors to this project.

## App Store

- Google Play Store: [Healthy Corners - Healthy Rewards Clerk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.calblueprint.HealthyCornersClerk)
