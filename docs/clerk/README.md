# Clerk Application

Tablet (iOS/Android compatible) application created with React Native, Expo, and Airtable as a backend / database.

::: warning NOTE
As of 12/28/2020, the Clerk app is **not yet** designed to be responsive/usable on small mobile devices like smart phones. Though it is possible to download the apps on phone-size devices, we strongly recommend using the app on tablet-size devices.
:::

This repo contains code for the clerk-facing application, designed for usage in parallel with a store's existing POS system (**not** to replace it). This README is meant to be a guide for contributors to this project.

You can test the [latest version (v1.1.3)](https://github.com/calblueprint/dccentralkitchen-clerks/releases/tag/v1.1.3) of the clerk app on Appetize at <http://tiny.cc/HCClerkWeb>
