A guide to the customer and companion clerk applications developed with Expo, React Native, and Airtable and built for DC Central Kitchen's "Healthy Corners" program by @calblueprint's 2019-2020 team.

Run `yarn docs:dev` to get the documentation site running locally (it'll default to localhost:8080, but terminal output will tell you)

Run `yarn surge docs/.vuepress/dist` to deploy to surge (I used [healthycornersrewards.surge.sh](healthycornersrewards.surge.sh), so perhaps that's already taken.. but it's kind of a just-for-fun thing to deploy right now.)
