# Important Links

## Short-links

We use editable short-links so the external links used throughout the apps can be easily updated without changing the code.

## Clerk Training Guide

We developed a guide on how to use the clerk tablet app to assist with clerk training and serve as an ongoing reference for clerks. This guide is also linked in the hamburger menu within the app. They should also be in a printable format.
