### Modifying or Adding Resource Categories
- Admins can add a new resource category directly in Airtable ([see 'Add a new category in Airtable'](../customer/resources.md#add-a-new-category-in-airtable)), but **until a developer adds the corresponding category in the app, resources with categories that don't match the existing categories will display under 'Miscellaneous'**.
- Modifying the order of resource categories also requires a developer ([see Developer guide](../customer/resources.md)).
- Resources can be tagged under multiple categories in Airtable and they will display multiple times under different headings.
